## Lab Questions

### In plain English describe the function and use of a multiplexer.
  * A multiplexer allows you to pick from multiple input signals and pass through to get one output based on
    constraints that you define.

### In plain English describe the function and use of a demultiplexer.
  * A demultiplexer is the opposite of a multiplexer; allowing you to choose the output from multiple outputs
    of a single input.

### What other uses might these circuits have? (Think Shannonâ€™s)
  * Another use of the circuits is to create a barrel shifter where an input can be shifted to one of multiple
  * outputs. If a multiplexer is used, one of many inputs could be chosen to them be shifted in the demultiplexer.
